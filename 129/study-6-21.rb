# Problem 17 - Dave

# Give an example of when it would make sense to manually write a custom getter method vs. using `attr_reader`.

class Person

  def initialize
    @type = "human"
  end

  def human
    "Type: #{@type}"
  end
end

# I would use a custom getter method when needing to add additional information to my return rather than the `attr_reader` which would would return the value of the instace variable it was invoked upon. In this example, we would want to provide additional context to the return value of the getter method.

man = Person.new
p man.human

# Rich's Answers

# It would make more sense to write a custom getter method vs. using `attr_reader` when we want to add additional functionality when accessing the value associated with a given instance variable. For example, let's say we want to be able to access the last 4 digits of a social security number, but we don't want the ability to access the entire number for privacy purposes. Instead of having an `attr_reader`, we could create a custom getter method that only retrieves the last 4 digits of the social.

# Here is how that would be implemented

class Person
  attr_reader :name
  
  def initialize(name, ssn)
    @name = name
    @ssn = ssn
  end

  def ssn
    @ssn.to_s[-4..-1].to_i
  end
end

susan = Person.new("Susan", 1234567890)
p susan.ssn # => 7890

end

p Triangle.sides
p Triangle.new.sides

# What can executing `Triangle.sides` return? What can executing `Triangle.new.sides` return? What does this demonstrate about class variables?

# Executing `Triangle.sides` will return `nil` because class variable `@@sides` is assigned to `nil` and is not reassigned prior.

# Executing `Triangle.new.sides` will return `3`, because when we instantiate a new `Triangle` object, Ruby automatically invokes the `initialize` constructor method and reassigns class variable `@@sides` to `3`.

# This demonstrates that one should use caution when incorporating class variables in code that involves inheritance, as reassignment of the class variable in subclass will affect the parent class and other subclasses as well..

Executing `Triangle.new.sides` will return `3`, because when we instantiate a new `Triangle` object, Ruby automatically invokes the `initialize` constructor method and reassigns class variable `@@sides` to `3`.

This demonstrates that one should use caution when incorporating class variables in code that involves inheritance, as reassignment of the class variable in subclass will affect the parent class and other subclasses as well.

Executing `Triangle.sides` returns `nil`, whereas executing `Triangle.new.sides` returns `3`. 

When we execute `Triangle.sides`, we are invoking the class method `sides` defined on lines 4-6. This method will return the value assigned to class variable `@@sides`. We can see on line 2 that `@@sides` has a value of `nil`, as it was assigned this value within the `Shape` class definition. Since we have not initialized any new `Triangle` or `Quadrilateral` class objects, this value is `nil`. 

When we execute `Triangle.new.sides`, however, we instantiate a new `Triangle` object. When we create a new object, its class's constructor method, `initialize` is called. The `initialize` constructor method for the `Triangle` class is defined on lines 14-16; when this method is called, class variable `@@sides` is reassigned to `3`. Therefore, when we invoke the `sides` instance method (defined on lines 8-10), Ruby outputs the new value of class variable `@@sides` which is `3`.

This demonstrates that class variables can be reassigned within subclasses; given this, one must be careful working with class variables if inheritance comes into play, and doing so is not recommended.
# Problem 18 - Rich

# Problem 19 - Dave

# What is the `attr_accessor` method, and why wouldnâ€™t we want to just add `attr_accessor` methods for every instance variable in our class? Give an example.

# The `attr_accessor` method is Ruby syntax for creating both a getter and a setter method for the specified instance variable. We would not want to use it for every instance variable in our class because we would not want to be able to always retrieve or reassign every instance variable, rather we would want to be intentional and specific.

class Car
  attr_accessor :color

  def initialize(car_color)
    self.color = car_color
    @wheels = 4
  end
end

# In the example above, there would be no reason to reassign a `Car` class object's `@wheels` instance variable, therefore, we would not need to create an `attr_accessor` method for it. Instead, upon initilaizing a new object, we would then assign the object's instance variable `@wheels` to the integer value `4`. 

------- Rich

# The `attr_accessor` method defines getter and setter methods for the instance variable passed to the `attr_accessor`. This is a faster, more efficient way to create these getter and setter methods, which allow instance variables to be accessed and reassigned. 

# While it may seem great to provide the functionality to access and reassign every instance variable, this is not a good idea. Oftentimes we have attributes that we do not want to be modified from outside the class; other times we may want the ability to modify an attribute without necessarily being able to view it outside the class (a prime example here would be sensitive information like passwords). Therefore, best practices would dictate only creating getter or setter methods that are specifically needed and leaving out what is not. This is also consistent with the goals of encapsulation.



# Problem 20 - Rich

# What is the difference between states and behaviors?

# What is the difference between states and behaviors?


# State consists of an instance's attributes (i.e., its instance variables and their associated values/data), whereas behaviors are what an instance can do through its instance methods. 

# State is unique to each instance of a class, whereas behavior generally is shared amongst instance of the same class (unless they incorporate state, in which case they may be slightly different).

# State cannot be inherited, whereas behavior can.



class Dog
  def initialize(name, gender)
    @name = name
    @gender = gender
  end

  def speak
    puts "woof"
  end
end

class Labrador < Dog
end

rodney = Labrador.new("Rodney", "male")
rodney.speak

# States or attributes dictate data/values encapsulated within in an individual object. Instance variables, denoted with a `@` prepending their name, for example, are used to keep track of the states of an object. 

# Behaviors, on the other hand, are the methods that objects in a given class can invoke, i.e. what those object can do. 

# Problem 21 - Dave

# What is the difference between instance methods and class methods?

# Instance methods are methods that pertain to a specific object within the specified class. They can be invoked only on an object.

def do
  #instance method behavior
end

object.do

# Class methods are methods that pertain to the entire class and can only be on invoked upon that class. Class methods when defined are prepended with the keyword `self`. This is how Ruby recognizes that it is a class method.

Class.do

def self.do
  #class method behavior
end


# Instance methods may rely on data encapsulated within an object for their implementation. In this case, it's possible to see different outputs or return values depending on the data within the calling object. The behavior, however, is always the same.

# Problem 22 - Rich

# What are collaborator objects, and what is the purpose of using them in OOP? Give an example of how we would work with one.

# Collaborator objects are objects that encapsulate the state of another object. Essentially, these collaborator objects are assigned to the instance variables of the other object. 

# As we are building containerized silos of information in the form of classes, modules, and objects when building a program using OOP principles, collaborator objects allow us to have those containers work together (i.e., collaborate!) in order to build a fully functional program that is readible and more easily maintained.

# Problem 23 - Dave

# How and why would we implement a fake operator in a custom class? Give an example.

# We would implement a fake operator in a custom class by defining an instance method utilizng the fake method's symbol. This would override the default operator method. We would do this if we wanted to create additional functionality or change the fuctionality of an operator to fit the custom class but to still ideally be aligned with the Ruby's core library standards.

# Nick's Sample Answer

class FarmAnimal
  def speak
    "#{self} says "
  end
end

class Sheep < FarmAnimal
  def speak
    super + "baa!"
  end
end

class Lamb < Sheep
  def speak
    super + "baaaaaaa!"
  end
end

class Cow < FarmAnimal
  def speak
    super + "mooooooo!"
  end
end

p Sheep.new.speak
p Lamb.new.speak
p Cow.new.speak 

# What is output and why?

# On line 25, `Sheep.new.speak` will output `"#<Sheep:0x00007f1da6ae4d20> says
# baa!"`. On line 26, `Lamb.new.speak` wil output `"#<Lamb:0x00007f1da6ae4a78>
# says baa!baaaaaaa!"`, and on line 27 `Cow.new.speak` will output
# `"#<Cow:0x00007f1da6ae4870> says mooooooo!"`. This is output because the
# `FarmAnimal#speak` method interpolates `self` into a string.

# `self`, when used within an instance method, references the calling object. When
# an object is interpolated into a string, the `to_s` method is implicitly called
# on the object. In this case, `to_s` being called on each object will return a
# string representation of the object it's called on, which will be the class it
# is instantiated from followed by the hexadecimal ID that represents the space it
# occupies in memory.

# The `Cow`, `Sheep` and `Lamb` classes all subclass from the `FarmAnimal`
# superclass. However, each class also defines their own `speak` method,
# overriding `FarmAnimal#speak`. Within each method definition, the keyword
# `super` is used, telling Ruby to search the method lookup path for each class,
# and find a method with the same name to invoke. The return value provided by
# `super` is then used to concatenate to another string.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The output of this code can be explained by understanding super. When we call super, Ruby will look up the inheritance chain for a method of the same name as the one where we're calling super. The first one it finds, it will invoke.

# When a Sheep object calls speak, we concatenate the return value of FarmAnimal#speak and baa!, hence we get 'Sheep says baa!' The call to FarmAnimal#speak occurs as a result of our call to super, and the fact that Sheep subclasses from FarmAnimal, meaning that this is the next speak method up the inheritance chain, and therefore what super will invoke.

# When a Lamb object calls speak, it concatenates the return value of a call to super with baaaaa!. This call to super will invoke the speak in Lambs superclass, Sheep . As discussed before, a call to Sheep#speak eventually returns whatever class the caller object is + `says baa!. This means finally we're concatenating 'Lamb says baa!' + 'baaaa!', hence the output from this line.

# Finally, Cow will go through a similar process, but Cow inherits directly from FarmAnimal, so we will simply get 'Cow says ' + 'mooooo!', where 'Cow says ' comes from our call to super, invoking FarmAnimal#speak and the string within it's own speak method.
